Planetary Science Data Service

PlanetServer is a Service component of the EC-funded EarthServer-2 project (#654367) aimed at serving and analyzing planetary data online, mainly through OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS). The focus of PlanetServer is on complex data, particularly hyperspectral imaging and topographic ones. Data from Mars, the Moon and other Solar System Bodies will be available and queriable.

Ingested datasets derive from NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) and ESA Planetary Science Archive (PSA). User interest and community feedback served as input and driver to PlanetServer features and capabilities. Moreover, PlanetServer aims at supportng collaborative data analysis, being able to share planetary data hosted on a database server and querying them from a web client through any supported web browser (Chrome is advised). Please find below all relevant project-wide and service-wide URLs.

EarthServer targets Earth Science domains through a Big Data Analytics approach, based on the open standards of OGC and W3C.
